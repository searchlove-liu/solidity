This library helps with reading and writing to such slots without the need for inline assembly. The functions in this library return Slot structs that contain a `value` member that can be used to read or write. Example usage to set ERC1967 implementation slot: ```solidity contract ERC1967 {     bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;     function _getImplementation() internal view returns (address) {         return StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value;     }     function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {         require(Address.isContract(newImplementation), \"ERC1967: new implementation is not a contract\");         StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;     } } ``` _Available since v4.1 for `address`, `bool`, `bytes32`, `uint256`._ _Available since v4.9 for `string`, `bytes`._",
