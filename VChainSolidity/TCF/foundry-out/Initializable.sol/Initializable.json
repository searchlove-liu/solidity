Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ====\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"stateVariables\":{\"_initialized\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\"},\"_initializing\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/openzeppelin_l/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":\"Initializable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"istanbul\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[\":@openzeppelin/contracts/=contracts/openzeppelin_l/contracts/\",\":forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/\"]},\"sources\":{\"contracts/openzeppelin_l/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x71a6fd2651bdb8bb73d9ef54a314b20289e37994011309a14e94ad1eada4a940\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://659ff25e7191d32e6e1f52c96a8fab92e4ce56dd3dd392cdb08499bf819a48fc\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmRrXVSECND3eWG8vXSyQ5NmVjco7jg9TVNZhsGrzo1FcV\"]},\"contracts/openzeppelin_l/contracts/utils/Address.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x4f73eedf878079f3c11b05bb9db39c789ae782c0c1a15a8a31ad36aa7047a32f\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://c23c79bf4124e0b203677c5ab55ce73d8faf43f0d5c49b071c9f9f16fee74249\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmNsMhnyeFS22LXmGGG7j6eto36bz8SEGbfDGPVu1EZcB8\"]}},\"version\":1}","metadata":{"compiler":{"version":"0.8.20+commit.a1b79de6"},"language":"Solidity","output":{"abi":[],"devdoc":{"kind":"dev","methods":{},"version":1},"userdoc":{"kind":"user","methods":{},"version":1}},"settings":{"remappings":["@openzeppelin/contracts/=contracts/openzeppelin_l/contracts/","forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/"],"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"compilationTarget":{"contracts/openzeppelin_l/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol":"Initializable"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{}},"sources":{"contracts/openzeppelin_l/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol":{"keccak256":"0x71a6fd2651bdb8bb73d9ef54a314b20289e37994011309a14e94ad1eada4a940","urls":["bzz-raw://659ff25e7191d32e6e1f52c96a8fab92e4ce56dd3dd392cdb08499bf819a48fc","dweb:/ipfs/QmRrXVSECND3eWG8vXSyQ5NmVjco7jg9TVNZhsGrzo1FcV"],"license":"MIT"},"contracts/openzeppelin_l/contracts/utils/Address.sol":{"keccak256":"0x4f73eedf878079f3c11b05bb9db39c789ae782c0c1a15a8a31ad36aa7047a32f","urls":["bzz-raw://c23c79bf4124e0b203677c5ab55ce73d8faf43f0d5c49b071c9f9f16fee74249","dweb:/ipfs/QmNsMhnyeFS22LXmGGG7j6eto36bz8SEGbfDGPVu1EZcB8"],"license":"MIT"}},"version":1},"id":17}
